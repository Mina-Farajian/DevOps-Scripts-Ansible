# Ansible Project for Debian and RedHat-Based Systems
This Ansible project is designed to simplify and automate various system administration and configuration tasks for both Debian and RedHat-based operating systems. It includes a collection of Ansible playbooks that can be used for daily DevOps tasks.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following components:

* playbooks: This directory contains Ansible playbooks for various tasks, categorized based on their use cases.

* inventory: Here, you can define inventory files that specify the hosts you want to manage with Ansible.

# Usage
To utilize this Ansible project for managing Debian and RedHat-based systems, follow these steps:

Review the playbooks in the playbooks directory and select the one that corresponds to the task you wish to perform.

Update the inventory file in the inventory directory to specify the hosts on which you want to apply the playbook.

Run the selected playbook using the ansible-playbook command. For example:
```
